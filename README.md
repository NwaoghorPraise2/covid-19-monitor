## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The project is a COVID-19 tracker website that provides real-time statistics on the global COVID-19 pandemic. The website displays information such as the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide. Users can also view country-specific data, including the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country.

The website features a simple and user-friendly interface, with a search bar that allows users to search for specific countries. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs and charts, which can be helpful in understanding trends and patterns in the pandemic.

In addition to the statistics, the website also provides news updates related to COVID-19, including the latest developments in vaccines, treatments, and public health policies.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
